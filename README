decibel-audio-player
------------------------------------------
Decibel Audio Player is a GTK+ open-source (GPL license) audio player 
designed for GNU/Linux, which aims at being very straightforward to use 
by means of a very clean and user friendly interface.

It aims also at being a real audio player and, as such, it does not 
include features that are not meant to be part of an audio player. These 
features (e.g., tagging) generally have a really better support in 
specialized software.
