RELEASE=3
CATEGORY="Audio"
SUMMARY="GTK+ audio player"
DESCRIPTION="Decibel Audio Player is a GTK+ open-source (GPL license) audio
player designed for GNU/Linux, which aims at being very straightforward to use
by means of a very clean and user friendly interface. It aims also at being a
real audio player and, as such, it does not include features that are not meant
to be part of an audio player. These features (e.g., tagging) generally have a
really better support in specialized software."
